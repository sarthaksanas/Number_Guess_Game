## 📌 About the Project

This project is a simple Python-based command-line game developed to demonstrate the use of:

- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Functions
- Input validation
- Modular code (with ASCII art imported from another file)

The player selects a difficulty level and tries to guess the number correctly within a limited number of attempts. The game provides hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" and lets the player know if they've won or lost. After each round, the user can choose to play again.
